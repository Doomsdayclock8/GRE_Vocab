If someone tends to be hypercritical and finds fault with everything, you can describe that person as _captious_. Try not to be described as a _captious_ person yourself, however. No one likes a carping individual!

_Captious_ comes from the Middle French word _captieux_, which is from the Latin word _captiosus_ meaning "fallacious or deceiving." This is, in fact, another meaning for the adjective _captious_, something calculated to confuse or deceive — such as a captious explanation of the facts. When a person is described as captious, the sense is usually of nitpicking at faults or raising petty objections. It is usually used to imply a permanent character or personality flaw, as opposed to a momentary lapse in understanding.
