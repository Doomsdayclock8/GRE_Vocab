### The adjective _macabre_ is used to describe things that involve the horror of death or violence. If a story involves lots of blood and gore, you can call it _macabre_.

This word first appeared in English in the context of the "Dance of Death," recounted in literature as the figure of Death leading people in a dance to the grave, and translated from the Old French _Danse Macabre._ The _Macabre_ part of the phrase is thought to be an alteration of _Macabe_, "a Maccabee," an allusion to the Maccabees, who were a Jewish people who led a revolt against the Seleucid Empire about 166 B.C.E. and were martyred in the process.
