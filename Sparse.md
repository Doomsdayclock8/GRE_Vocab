Something that’s _sparse_ is thin, not dense. If you’re looking for the perfect place to build a tree house, a _sparse_ forest is probably not your best bet.

From the Latin _sparsus_, meaning “scattered,” we get the adjective _sparse_, which means “few and scattered.” Thinning hair is sparse, as is the population of an endangered species. Or a small and scattered crowd for an unpopular band. Synonyms include _dispersed_, _infrequent_, and _scanty_. Antonyms, on the other hand, include _full_, _lush_, and _plentiful_.
