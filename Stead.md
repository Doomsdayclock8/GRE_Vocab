Someone's _stead_ is their position, or occupation. The eager understudy to starring role leapt at the chance to serve in the lead actor's _stead_ when he mysteriously got food poisoning.

_Stead_ comes from the Germanic root for "place, town," but we usually use it for a person's place, and most frequently when someone is serving as a substitute. If you serve in someone's stead, you're doing their job for them while they're not there. You probably intuitively know this word from the more common _instead_, which is just a shortening for "in the stead of."
