### Someone who is firm and determined in a belief or a position can be called _steadfast_ in that view, like your mom when she thinks you really shouldn’t wear that outfit.

The word _steadfast_ traces back to the Old English word _stedefæst_, a combination of _stede_, meaning "place," and _fæst_, meaning "firmly fixed." Picture a steadfast person standing firmly in place, not wavering or budging an inch, and you’ll have a good sense of what this word means. Someone can be steadfast in a belief, an effort, a plan, or even a refusal. Whatever it is, it means that the person will calmly hold firm to the chosen position and follow through with determination.
